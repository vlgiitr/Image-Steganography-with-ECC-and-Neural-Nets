Paper : [A New High Capacity Image Steganography Method Combined With Image Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Deep Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8981989)

## Project Structure

- ecc.py : Implements ECC Cryptography. Uses secp256k1 curve
- encrypt.py : Follows the encryption method in the paper closely
- utlis.py : General utils

## Setup Instructions

- Clone this repo
- Create a virtual enviournment `virtualenv venv`
- Activate the enviournment `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
