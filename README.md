Paper : [A New High Capacity Image Steganography Method Combined With Image Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Deep Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8981989)

## Project Structure

- ecc.py : Implements ECC Cryptography. Uses secp256k1 curve
- encrypt.py : Follows the encryption method in the paper closely
- utlis.py : General utils

## Setup Instructions

- git clone https://github.com/vlgiitr/PassFormer.git
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
